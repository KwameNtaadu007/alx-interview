# 0x01-lockboxes

**Overview:**
This project aims to develop an efficient algorithm to determine if all boxes in a given set can be opened, considering the availability of keys inside the boxes. The solution will involve leveraging concepts from graph theory, algorithmic complexity, recursion, and data structures like lists, queues, stacks, and sets. Python will be the primary programming language used for implementation.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Lists and List Manipulation:**
   - Understanding the manipulation of lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically.
   - Resources: [Python Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)

2. **Graph Theory Basics:**
   - Knowledge of graph theory, particularly traversal algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS), will aid in solving the problem.
   - Resources: [Graph Theory - Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms)

3. **Algorithmic Complexity:**
   - Understanding the time and space complexity of the solution is essential for writing efficient algorithms.
   - Resources: [Big O Notation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/big-o-notation/)

4. **Recursion:**
   - Some solutions may require a recursive approach for traversing through the boxes and keys.
   - Resources: [Recursion in Python](https://realpython.com/python-recursion/)

5. **Queue and Stack:**
   - Knowledge of using queues and stacks is crucial for implementing BFS or DFS algorithms to traverse through the keys and boxes.
   - Resources: [Python Queue and Stack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-queue-python-using-module-queue/)

6. **Set Operations:**
   - Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.
   - Resources: [Python Sets](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets)
